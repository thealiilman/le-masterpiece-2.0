			<p>My name is Ali Ilman and thank you for visiting my website!<br>I'm a 16 year old front-end developer from Malaysia. I first discovered about programming at the age of 13. Ever since then, I've been breaking things to gain knowledge. The more you break, the more you'll learn!<br><br>Other than front-end development, I'm learning how to do back-end development since I aspire to be a full-stack developer, both JS and non-JS.<br>My favourite band is Oasis and my favourite colour is red. And no, I'm not named after the boxing legend!</p>
